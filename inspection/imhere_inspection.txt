Format for comments
line # : comment

overall:
	route structure is a mess
	need comments on each route
	should be reasonably obvious from route what page you are on
	POSTs should be used more for forms
	need more comments
	coding conventions: 2 lines between methods, 1 line between blocks
	split GET and POST methods

11 : sqlalchemy import *, only import what we need

14 : potentially break up long import

24 : program does not handle failed connection to database, keeps running

70 : add rationale for commenting out token code

78 : do we need the exception?

85 : GET instead of a POST

101, 106 : restrict to just a GET

110 : TODO is done

119 : trailing slash on route, mixed GET and POST in method

185 : trailing slash on teacher, mixed GET and POST, potential refactor

254 : can refactor operations into seperate functions to break up huge route logic

320 : trailing slash on view_requests, clean up common code

389 : comments migrated down file somehow

399 : all SQL should be in model files, exception handling not consistent

438 : more comments about how it works and different routes

477 : logout does not need to be POST

483 : main is no longer used, we run through run.py
