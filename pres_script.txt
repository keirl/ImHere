This is our presentation plan for our showcase demo on 12/12/16:

We have already created 2 accounts that are currently in the database for the presentation.
jty2106@columbia.edu is listed as both a student and a teacher.

Make sure James is logged into his email on the computer and not in Incognito mode.

From the Home page, click on the Register button to show how one would create a user account for
the application. We already have James' account in the database for example purposes.

Go back and Login as James to demonstrate the Google SSO utility that we implemented.
The email is jty2106@columbia.edu
*** May want to open a seperate tab for each view

Create a class and add 'jty2106' to the class.
Show that the class is now visible from both views.

Open a check-in window from the teacher view and show the random code generated.
See that the class from the Student view now has check-in available, then check-in.
Close the check-in window from the Teacher view and see that it is no longer available
to the student.

Show that the student can see his attendence record for all sessions in a class.

Demonstrate the Teacher's ability to edit the record by removing the student from a given session.

Show that the student can now see they were removed from a session and submit a change request.
The request is now visible to the student as 'pending'.
The change request is now visible from the teacher view and can be accepted or denied.
Accept it, and see from the student view that the error has been corrected.

Finally, show that a teacher has the ability to delete a session completely.
